## **Self-Updating Portfolio with Gitfolio & GitHub Actions**

This solution combines **Gitfolio** with **GitHub Actions** to create a fully automated system that keeps your portfolio fresh and up-to-date. With this setup, your GitHub repository acts as the source of your portfolio content, and GitHub Actions handles automatic updates and deployments to GitHub Pages.

### **How This Works**

This system uses **Gitfolio** and **GitHub Actions** to automate the creation, update, and deployment of your portfolio:

1. **Scheduled Updates**: GitHub Actions runs every 10 minutes to ensure your portfolio stays updated.
2. **Effortless Deployment**: The workflow automatically deploys the updated portfolio to GitHub Pages, ensuring it's live 24/7.

### **Features**

- **Self-Updating & Automated Deployment**: The system automatically updates your portfolio every 10 minutes and deploys the changes to GitHub Pages, making it accessible online without manual intervention.
- **Easy Customization**: Customize your portfolio's layout and content by modifying Gitfolio's settings to match your personal style.

### **Why Choose This Approach?**

This setup eliminates the need for manual updates to your portfolio. GitHub Actions runs every 10 minutes to ensure your portfolio stays current without any effort on your part!

### **Customization and Extensibility**

- **Custom Branch**: If you want to deploy from a branch other than `main` (e.g., `gh-pages`), simply adjust the workflow and GitHub Pages settings.
- **Customize Portfolio Layout**: Modify the `.gitfolio.yml` file to change the design, add sections, or filter repositories.
- **Frequent Updates**: Adjust the frequency of the GitHub Actions workflow if you need it to run more or less frequently.

### **Setup Instructions**

1. **Fork the Repository**: Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Enable GitHub Actions**: 
   - Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository and enable GitHub Actions.
   - Enable the **Build and Deploy Gitfolio** workflow.
3. **Edit Config File**: 
   - Open the `dist/config.json` file and update it with your GitHub username and preferences. 
   - Below is a sample configuration for reference:
   
   ```json
   [
     {
       "username": "your-github-username",  // Replace with your GitHub username
       "name": "Your Full Name",            // Your name (auto-generated from Gitfolio)
       "userimg": "",                       // Profile picture URL (auto-generated by Gitfolio)
       "sort": "created",                   // Sorting repositories by creation, updated, pushed, etc.
       "order": "desc",                     // Order: ascending or descending
       "includeFork": false,                // Include forked repositories: true or false
       "theme": "dark.css",                 // Theme choice: dark or light
       "types": ["owner"],                  // Repository types: owner, member, etc.
       "twitter": "",                       // Twitter handle (optional)
       "linkedin": "",                      // LinkedIn handle (optional)
       "medium": "",                        // Medium handle (optional)
       "dribbble": ""                       // Dribbble handle (optional)
     }
   ]
   ```

4. **Repository Settings**:
   - Go to **Settings** > **Pages**.
   - Set **Source** to `gh-pages` branch and save.
   - Wait for a minute for the changes to take effect.

5. **Your Portfolio is Live!**: After reloading, your portfolio will be live at `https://your-github-username.github.io/portfolio/`.
